## Credit Card Fraud Detection 
* This is the README file for a project that detects credit card fraud using machine learning.

*Data:*

* The data is from a credit card company and contains information about transactions, including the amount, time, and whether the transaction was fraudulent.
The data is imbalanced, with a much smaller number of fraudulent transactions than non-fraudulent transactions.

*Preprocessing:*

1. Missing values are handled (e.g., filled with mean or median).
2. The data is scaled to ensure all features have similar ranges.
3. The data is split into training and testing sets.

*Models:*

* Two machine learning models are used: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
* Both models are trained on the training data.

*Evaluation:*

1. The models are evaluated on the testing data using precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. The results show that both models perform well, with Logistic Regression having slightly better performance.

*Conclusion:*

* This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to detect credit card fraud.
* The results show that the models are able to accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

*Exploration:*

1. Cost-sensitive learning could be used to emphasize the importance of correctly classifying fraudulent transactions.
2. Anomaly detection techniques could be used to identify unusual transactions that may be fraudulent.
